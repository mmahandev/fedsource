        <h2>Keeping up with the front-end development world is hard.</h2>
        <p>So I created FEDSource as a content aggregator that pulls resources from around the internet.</p>
        <p>Only basic functionality is added so far. This is a side project that is still a work in progress.</p>
        <p>Please contact {'< admin at fedsource.io >'} for any questions.</p>
